# Alternative Neural Networks.

In this repo we dive into alternative neural network structures for image classification on the Mnist Fashion test data set.

We apply basic pytorch classification with a convolutional neural network.

We then apply SNNTorch to the problem: https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Finally we include AdderNet: https://github.com/huawei-noah/AdderNet
