# Alternative Neural Networks.

In this repo we dive into alternative neural network structures for image classification on the Mnist Fashion test data set.
- Base code was applied from: https://github.com/pytorch/ignite/blob/master/examples/notebooks/FashionMNIST.ipynb
- We apply basic pytorch classification with a convolutional neural network.
- We then apply AdderNet: https://github.com/huawei-noah/AdderNet
- We then apply SNNTorch to the problem: https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Finally we apply AdderNet with SNNTorch
